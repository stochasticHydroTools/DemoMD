# Tutorial codes for molecular dynamics.

These codes illustrate the (positional) Verlet algorithm for Molecular Dynamics. The parameters are set up to start in a gas state but then a small droplet should nucleate. Increase the number of atoms for larger droplets (but you may need to wait longer).

At present visualization is broken, though
